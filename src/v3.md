Trust-Chain Version 2
=====================

Description
-----------
A simple chain of trust that can be used to varify the authenticity of a chain of public keys, with only prior knowledge of a root public key.
Each version of trustChain will define the Public Key, Signature, and Digest algorithms to be used. No other algorithm shall be used.
Over time as newer algorithms emerge, the TrustChains should be migrated / updated rather than building a flexible container. 
Implementors should be ready to support multiple versions of TrustChain.

Version3 Algorithms:
    PublicKeyAlgorithm =: CURVE25519 
    SignatureAlgorithm =: ED25519


Model Version of
-----

PublicKey  =: 32 bytes 
Signature  =: 64 Bytes 
Link       =: (PublicKey, Signature)
TrustChain =: (Version, Root, [Link]) 

The Verifier need only have prior knowledge of the root public key, to validate each intermediary public key, 
and finaly the final public key.

| Field              | Bytes | Description
| ------------------ | ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tag                | 2     | 0x54,0x43 ; ASCII for "TC"                                                                   |

| Trust Chain Length | 1     | 1-byte unsigned integer. Represents the number of Links that follow including the root key.  |
|                    |       | Must not exceed value of 0x05 for this version.                                              |
| Trust Chain Root   | 32    | 32-byte root public key. Validators must already have this key in their trust store.         |
| Trust Chain Links  | Vari  | Variable number of Link records equal to the value specified in the previous                 | 
|                    |       | byte (Trust Chain Length)                                                                    | 

`Link               =: (PublicKey, Signature)`

| Field              | Bytes | Description
| ------------------ | ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| PublicKey          | 32    | The Curve25519 Public Key material for this link.                                            |
| Signature          | 64    | The Ed25519 signature of the Public Key value, using the previous public key in the          |
|                    |       | chain (or root at chain start).                                                              |
